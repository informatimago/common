bjlib       A simplified version of Bourguignon's C Library. 
            A collection of C modules.

benlib      Bourguignon's Encoding Library.  Like iconv(1), but much
            less comprehensive.  But iconv does not have these encodings:
              - Honeywell 200/2000 series SSF tapes
              - Honeywell 600/6000 series SSF tapes 
            See: http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/

bolib       Bourguignon's Objective-C Library. A few Objective-C classes.

bplib       Bourguignon's C++ Library. A few C++ classes.

bprib       Bourguignon's C++ RIB Library. RIB = Relevés d'Identité Bancaire,
            ie. French standardized bank account numbers. (There's now an
            englobing IBAN standard for European account numbers).
            Compute and check RIB keys.

bpcombi     Bourguignon's C++ Combinatorial Library. Enumerate
            combinations and arrangements (generating the permutations
            lazily, possibly allowing the generation of very set, time
            being the only limiting factor).
