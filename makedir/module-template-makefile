#DESCRIPTION
#	This Makefile tells how to compile a specific module.
#   Well, in most case, we just change to the source directory and make.
#   But some module may have more complicated build process, or may
#   want to make tests in addition.
#
#	Input variables are:
#
#       $(MAKEDIR)      where the makefiles are located.
#
#       $(PREFIX)   where the libraries are installed.
#                       It will be created a subdirectory in this 
#                       $(PREFIX) for each library compiled by 
#                       this makefile.
#
#       $(TARGET)       the name of the platform on which we're compiling.
#                       This is just used to include platform specific
#                       makefile rules.
#
#	Output:
#
#		$(PREFIX)/bin/$(PROGRAM)           the executables.
#		$(PREFIX)/$(MODULE)/interfaces/    the interface of the module,
#		$(PREFIX)/$(MODULE)/documentation/ the documentation of the module,
#		$(PREFIX)/$(MODULE)/libraries/     the libraries of the module.
